Description: Package implements Kernel-based Regularized Least Squares (KRLS), a machine learning method to fit multidimensional functions y=f(x) for regression and classification problems without relying on linearity or additivity assumptions. KRLS finds the best fitting function by minimizing the squared loss of a Tikhonov regularization problem, using Gaussian kernels as radial basis functions. For further details see Hainmueller and Hazlett (2014).
